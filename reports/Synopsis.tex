\textbf{\huge Problem Statement}
\begin{justify}
{\Large Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an essential tool for anyone who needs to learn, teach or research sorting algorithms. It provides a clear and interactive way to understand the working of different sorting algorithms.
The visualizations created by Sorting Algorithm Visualizer are easy to interpret and follow, making it an ideal tool for students, teachers, and researchers alike. With Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, one can gain a comprehensive understanding of the sorting process, and how different algorithms perform under different conditions.}

\textbf{\huge Detailed Description}
\begin{justify}
{\Large The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a C++ software application that employs the OpenGL library for graphics rendering. It enables users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action through a user-friendly interface. The visualizer comprises an array of bars that represent the elements to be sorted, and a visualization of the algorithm's progress as it sorts the array.
The bars are color-coded to show their relative position in the array and to highlight the swapping process. Users can customize the size of the array, the speed of the visualization, and the color scheme. They can choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort.}
